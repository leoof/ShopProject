# ShopProject

* A basic ShopProject using the Tkinter plugin in Python. Made by a group of beginner coders. Please don't hate. 🙏
* Mostly written using Repl.it for collaboration but PyCharm has been used for ease of work and just general coding support. 📚
* Feel free to edit to improve - we're all ears over here! 👂
* With credit to TT, BN, JP and the rest of our fantastic team. 👍
* Any questions, feel free to message me. ❓


* That's why yo mama dead.

* That's why your granny aint have no knees.
* She can't pray to jesus.

### Thanks, the Shop Project team.
