# ShopProject

* A basic ShopProject using the Tkinter plugin in Python. Made by a group of beginner coders. Please don't hate.
* Mostly written using Repl.it for collaboration but PyCharm has been used for ease of work and just general coding support
* Feel free to edit to improve - we're all ears over here!
* With credit to TT, BN, JP and the rest of our fantastic team.
* Any questions, feel free to message me.

### Thanks, the Shop Project team.
